What is version control and why is it important?
Version Control is a way to control the changes of an application.
With it we can know who made the changes, when and why.
It is important to keep this information because when the application grows,
it will be hard to know what happened with it. And when we have a team coding together,
we need to know who made the changes, which task describes the change and why it
 was request.

In some team using git repositories, maybe an developer add a new feature that interfers in the login and stoped the application,
using version control we can return to the previous code then solve the problem and commit it again.
Imagine that two team members of this teams are working in the same application, 
both need to remember to use 'git pull' before start coding
it will update the local code with the changes made in the remote repository.
And to write a good message when use 'git commit -m "Some message"' to describe what have do done.
